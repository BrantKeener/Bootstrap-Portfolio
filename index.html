                        <p>Currently I work as a Medical Laboratory Scientist (MLS). As an MLS in transfusion medicine,
                            I, along with my team, work together to ensure that patients are transfused with blood that
                            is both safe and efficacious.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Prior to working as an MLS, I worked as an Airframe and Powerplant technician. Specifically,
                            I worked as an electrician on both commercial and private aircraft. Installation and
                            troubleshooting were very important parts of this job.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>As a student in the Denver University Bootcamp, I have greatly increased my knowledge in web
                            development in a very short time. I believe that humans are most happy when they are
                            creating, and this is exactly what web development allows me to do.</p>
